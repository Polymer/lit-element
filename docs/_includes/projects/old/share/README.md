This page is about sharing data upwards (from child to parent elements). For info about binding data downwards (from a parent element to a child element), see [data binding](/data/bind). 

lit-element doesn't support two-way data binding. To get the same effect, you have a few options.

## Props down, events up

For downwards data flow, use property bindings.

For upwards data flow, use events.

## State management
